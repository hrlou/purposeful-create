# Purposeful Create
Automation and industries with purpose!

Purposeful Create is a simple modpack that aims to enhance the vanilla experience,
and add some needed difficulty.
Centring around Create with some other fun additions,
filling gaps in the vanilla experience; making your progress feel more purposeful.
New biomes, enemies, and resources to discover and exploit. 

On your adventure you'll have to deal with changing seasons,
temperature and wider range of tough enemies to stand in your way as you carve your industrial civilisation.
The pack includes a wide range of optimisations and visual tweeks,
allowing the game to run stably and beautifully. 

## Goal

My biggest issue with Minecraft is a lack of purpose and insensitive for your actions.
The game provides a vast toolset to carve any world of your choosing. However the central survival gameplay loop gives no insentive for you to use its toolbox to its full extent.

Create expands on Minecraft's toolbox to the world of engineering extremely organically;
its style is indistinguishable from vanilla.
This expanded toolbox can be used to create machines and contraptions,
which most importantly have insentive. The Create developers share my issue and have done an absolutely fantastic job of remedying it. 

I wanted to further expand on Create by combining it with other mods,
thus I created this modpack following these rules. 

### Rules

- Content must have a purpose, content must not be obsolescent by default

- Not all resources can be renewable, there needs to be a reason to further explore/exploit the world

- Players shouldn't be able to become 'godlike' and should instead have to rely upond machines. Equipment should provide advantages but still leave room for difficulty, even in the end game
